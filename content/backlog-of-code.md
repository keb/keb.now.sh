# backlog of code

It has occurred to me that I put far too many projects in the backburner, alternating between multiple projects whilst completing none of them. For this reason, I think I should start a priority queue for my projects and include notes/thoughts on each project.

---

### In order of intended completion

-   colm
	* clone existing project repository instead of rewriting; fix bugs and implement new state management pattern
    * either rename to ettorss or implement rss feed into colm

-   steam friend night
	* this might be better suited as a rewrite
    * optionally - add new features
    * reimplement server in either php or node as the flask backend has proven unwieldy
-   its-drm-free
    -   lit-html based user script
-   backdog
	* implement server in node, php, or phoenix
    * integrate IGDB API
-   eBay frontend
    -   use eBay search api to create a prettier SPA frontend for eBay that makes it easier to filter results
-   last.fm alternative
-   rofi for windows
-   haxeflixel unnamed project
	* complete textbook
-   fuzzget
	* write tests

### Misc ideas

-   write.as blog ActivityPub aggregator
	* A simple webapp that aggregates latest write.as blogs/posts
-   ActivityPub-powered embeddable commenting
-   Steam wishlist scraper
	* An app that will scrape your wishlist for you, and tell you if games are available on GOG.com or other platforms
    * or Steam -> GOG Wishlist Converter
-   a micro-web framework for wren
-   cartoon-themed web design service
-   Crowd ghost editing / ghost writing platform
	* A platform for blog writers and freelance editors to edit blogs & foster working relationships
    * producthunt.com
-   Emulator party
	* Like Netflix party, but everyone plays the same game at the same time
-   VPS Server
	* host rocket.chat instance
    * host gitea instance

### Joke Apps

-   Fake Harry Potter quiz, where every result is a character not from the Harry Potter universe
-   A static page with a drawing of "Metaduck"
