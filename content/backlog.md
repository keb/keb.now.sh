## Completed

### Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective
  * **4/5** - A story-driven puzzle/adventure detective story that weaves together themes of mystery, poltergeist, time travel, and the love between owners and their pets. Surprisingly heartfelt for a goofy, anime detective story, but about as contrived and convoluted as you'd expect from the director of the Phoenix Wright games. All of the puzzles (with the exception of 2 of them...) are clever and satisfying to solve. The characters are all distinct and likable in their own respects. The ending -- while it certainly threw me for a loop -- made me want to hug my cat.

### Gunstar Heroes
  * **3/5** - I know I'll be tarred and feathered for this -- I honestly believe this game to be one of the most overrated games of the 16-bit era. I commend Treasure for the spectacle and exhilirating gunplay of Gunstar Heroes, not to mention the fantastic visuals and music. But this game is greatly hindered by a frustrating control scheme, and weird imprecise inputs. The levels are laid out Megaman-style, but vary greatly in difficulty. Some of the boss fights and level checkpoints are just flat out unfair. Better enjoyed with a second player.

### DOOM (2016)
  * **4/5** - DOOM is pure video game. Great fun, good challenge, nice visuals, cool music. Some sections are confusingly long-winded, and some of the platforming can feel unnecessary. Otherwise, a perfect revival of a classic.

### Divinity: Original Sin 2
  * **4/5** - Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a flawed game, but it's a game that wears its flaws on its sleeve. The first chapter can be a slog, and the amount of players in your party affect the experience greatly. Combat, while difficult from the onset, lures you into a false sense of security midway through the game before the difficulty curve spikes in the penultimate chapter to the point where you're wondering if you can even finish the game. So while DOS2 is still a messy, unbalanced, unforgiving Eurogame like its predecessors, its polish, clever gameplay, and sheer ambition make it shine above other modern RPGs.

### Mega Man X2
  * **3/5** - A good follow-up to the influential Mega Man X, albeit, as formulaic as you'd expect from a Mega Man game. What makes X2 more interesting than the original is the addition of the mid-air dash ability, which dramatically changes X's mobility and thus the pace and approach for every boss fight. Highly recommended.

### Shatter
  * **4/5** - A modern re-interpretation of Breakout/Arkanoid-type games. It's very, very fun.

### Sayonara Wild Hearts
  * **1/5** - While the art and music complement each other nicely, Sayonara Wild Hearts feels like a videogame created by a music video director for the sole purpose of being featured in award show trailers and E3 show reels. It *looks* and *sounds* amazing, but at its best plays like an awful REZ ripoff, and at its worst (which makes up for most of the playtime) plays like an on-rails, QTE-laden, endless runner with flimsy rhythm game elements that ultimately don't really matter unless you really want to chase high scores. Perhaps this is a great game to show to friends and family who have passing interest in videogames, only for the fact that it's so flashy and visually appealing.

### DISTRAINT
  * **2/5** - Cool style, cool art, good job mimicking the psychological horror style made popular by games like Silent Hill. I get strong Yuri Norstein vibes. Story is pretty boring and uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out enough to care about. Overall a decent, short adventure game experience.

### ABZU
  * **2/5** - ABZU is a beautifully stylish visual experience. The gameplay, however, consists solely of opening doors, and it's as boring as it sounds. Character movement only begins to become fun during the last 15 minutes of this 1.5 hour journey.

### Bleed 2
  * **3/5** - A very fun, and very short indie platformer/bullet-hell shmup. Bleed 2 continues in the tradition of the original with responsive controls and super fluid & hyperactive gameplay. The story mode can be completed in about an hour. Bleed 2's story mode is forgiving with checkpoints, so I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty. Nice retro graphics and a slick visual style, although with some questionable artistic decisions in regards to character design.

### Kirby's Adventure
  * **2/5** - Kirby's Adventure is a fantastic platformer that released near the end of the NES's lifecycle. It has great level design, sound design, gameplay, and arguably the best visuals & art design of any game on the NES -- they are so good, that this game still looks great to this day. However, the poor NES could *barely* handle the sheer amount of enemies and effects going on at once. As a result, if you're playing this on the NES or a cycle-accurate emulator (like Mesen), the game will suffer from horrendous slowdown which in turn causes button inputs to be dropped entirely, making the game massively frustrating at times, to flatout unplayable during the most chaotic sections. Kirby's Adventure was remade in 2002 for the Gameboy Advance as "Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland" without the slowdown or performance issues. While I do prefer the visuals of the original NES game, I'd recommend the GBA remake based on my experience with the original. Or you might better off playing using a romhack or different emulator that solves the input-dropping issues (I used Mesen). If not for these performance issues, this game would be an easy 4/5.

### AM2R
  * **4/5** - An excellent and much needed reimagining of Metroid II in the style of the GBA-era Metroid games (Zero Mission, Fusion). As a fangame, it near perfectly matches the official Nintendo titles in level design, bosses, and audio/visual values.

### Remnant: From the Ashes
  * **3/5** - (Co-Op) A third-person shooter/RPG hybird that is often associated with the "Souls-like" subgenre. I would only call Remnant a souls-like superficially. There are the equivalents of bonfires from Dark Souls/Demon's Souls; boss fights are preluded by fog doors and have multiple phases usually triggered by HP thresholds; you have a refillable health-regen item that you can upgrade with items found in the world. There are other smaller similarities, but otherwise, this game is completely different, with combat that is *very* standard, generic third-person shooter-fare (without a cover system, which was an odd exclusion in my opinion). Character builds are based on item/weapon bonuses & perks upgraded via "Trait" points. Bosses and environments are nowhere near the quality of Souls games. In particular, there are only 3 environments in this game, 2 of which are painfully underwhelming visually. Campaigns and Adventure modes are semi-procedurally generated with scalable difficulties. There is replay value here, however, this game is meant to be played co-op. Single-player is a bore.

### Outland
  * **3/5** - (Co-Op) A 2D metroidvania-lite action platformer with a distinct visual style influenced by Southeast Asian mythology. The character abilities are all rather generic for this brand of game, and the enemy variety is severely lacking. This game's primary gimmick is its mix of platforming with the polarity system and bullethell style of gameplay, pretty plainly lifted off Ikaruga. Overall the game is challenging enough to be satisfying, especially with another player. Note that online multiplayer suffers from noticeable input lag.

### Furi
  * **3/5** - A hack-n-slash/bullet hell boss rush with a French-anime art style that hearkens back to cyberpunk samurai cartoons you maybe watched as a kid. The mixture of parry-centric swordplay with bullet hell works very well and makes for some exhilirating combat. Some of the bosses have a few poorly designed phases, but overall, the game has good focus and delivers what it promises. The acid-house/synthwave electronic music also complements the gameplay fantastically. The writing and "cutscenes" are typical anime dreck.

### No Players Online
  * **3/5** - An interesting (and free!) take on interactive horror that pays homage to first person shooters of the early 00s, and the all too common experience of revisiting a once beloved online multiplayer game, only to find that the servers are completely empty. The concept of haunted digital spaces inhabited by some tormented cyber entity is not a new one, but No Players Online does a great job of inspiring player curiosity and meta-commentary of just what this game actually is. "Completing" the game involves taking part in a kind of scavenger hunt ARG for clues, some of which involve downloading a completely different itch.io title to progress, and calling a phone number (that is now inactive, although the prerecorded message is now on Bandcamp).

### OFF
  * **2/5** - Another RPG Maker cult favorite that is unrelenting in fulfilling its author's vision. A tough one to place; uses the bog standard out-of-the-box RPG Maker turn-based combat, even keeping the included stock sound effects. The game is translated from French, and at times it felt the translator was leaning a little too heavy on a thesaurus (specifically for the Judge character). The visuals are particularly inspired, being highly surreal and carrying with them a street art-like quality that reminds me of the schizophrenic line art and harsh contrasting colors of Jet Grind Radio. Some confusing use of overly compressed public domain art. OFF seems to relish in its own weirdness a little too much at times, and the gameplay and puzzles suffer for it. An interesting exercise in world-building (which is fitting, given the game's plot).

### Ib
  * **3/5** - An RPG Maker modern classic. A horror game with a creepy atmosphere and multiple endings. Cute plot, and inconsistent visuals. Freeware.

### Minit
  * **2/5** - A game about swords and corporate greed. But mostly a cute indie game that minifies Majora's Mask time travel mechanic to a mere 60 seconds. The gimmick is stretched thin quickly and the game barely does it any justice aside from extract tedium from it. The monochrome graphics, while an obvious stylistic choice, are grating to look at. Decent chiptune music. Fortunately the game does not outstay its welcome.

### Celeste
  * **4/5** - A fantastic modern platformer that is at times brutally unforgiving. The story presents a nice message but without much subtlety, and is sometimes excruciatingly on the nose. Great soundtrack.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  * **4/5** - A landmark in open-world 3D game development. After over a decade of sticking to a proven formula, Nintendo took inspiration from the series' roots and reinvented the series whilst making bold innovations to the genre.

### Inside
  * **3/5** - A 2D adventure reminiscent of Limbo. Bleak, haunting presentation with glimpses of a more personal message, tied together with mediocre gameplay.

### Dragon Quest III (SNES)
  * **2/5** - A classic 2D JRPG that influenced a decade of role-playing games to come. Charming dialogue and world-building, undercut by turn-based gameplay that has not aged well, and a ridiculous need for grind.

### The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  * **4/5** - Great dialogue, great graphics, great characterization. One of the most fleshed out open-world 3D games ever created.

### Resident Evil 2
  * **4/5** - A successor to the legendary survival horror video game that hits all the marks and improves upon the gameplay of the original.

### Resident Evil 0
  * **3/5** - A good rendition of the ol' Resident Evil formula with worthy visuals and level design. Some clunky new mechanics made its way into this game.

### Resident Evil HD Remaster
  * **5/5** - The definitive way to play the greatest survival horror game of all time.

## Abandoned

### Ganpuru: Gunman's Proof
  * Ganpuru is a game released late in the Super Famicom's lifespan. A Japan-only game, Ganpuru's visuals draw heavily from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. And by "heavily" I mean it straight rips off the visuals from Zelda. Despite it's Zelda-esque appearance, Ganpuru actually plays very little like Zelda's RPG-lite gameplay, and instead feels more like a retro twin-stick shooter. My issue with Ganpuru is its minimal gameplay loop is stretched ridiculously thin. By the second dungeon, the game already feels stale, despite it introducing more weapons for the player to use. Despite its shortcomings, Ganpuru seems like a game designed and targeted toward children, and that's likely the audience that would enjoy this game the most.

### Skygunner
  * Skygunner is a difficult game to place... and a difficult game in general. Underneath its bad anime art and cutesy exterior lies a deceivingly complex game where your performance is better measured by the amount of "cash" you obtain by the end of a mission, rather than if you completed the mission at all -- infact, completing missions is not the challenge here. Cash is essentially your score for a given mission, which can be increased further by multipliers which can be obtained by completing objectives quicker, and dispatching enemy fighters with missile chains. The catch is that every use of a weapon *lowers* your overall cash, so you must be conservative with how often you fire your weapons. The result of all of this is a bipolar difficulty curve and controls that betray your best interests -- Skygunner demands that you be precise, but in an effort to be accessible, gives the player a glossy, over-simplified control scheme. There's a brilliant game in here somewhere, but it will take the time and patience of a high-score chaser or an aerial combat enthusiast to find.

### Tobe's Vertical Adventure
  * A cute indie puzzle platformer with good pixelart, grating music, and bad controls. Would make an ideal mobile game.

### Shelter 2
  * Shelter 2 is a game that is needlessly open-world with half-baked, barely functioning mechanics that can't hold the weight of an ultimately meaningless gameplay loop.

### Haunted PS1 Demo Disc 2020
  * A collection of mostly short, mostly surreal, mostly walking simulator horror indie games from itch. Some gems (Neko Yume, Tasty Ramen), but it's hard to have patience for generic horror games that are even sometimes completely broken. Still, the concept and the effort is admirable. I'd like to see more "demo disc" releases in the future.

### Night In The Woods
  * A game with fantastic visuals, animation, and music that places more emphasis on its narrative and (unfortunately) uninteresting characters than its gameplay, which is practically non-existent at least for the first couple hours of playtime. The humor of this game regularly falls flat and can be called anything but timeless -- much of it is equivalent to the quirky randomness you'd probably encounter everyday from browsing your Twitter feed. Like many from this era of narrative-driven indie games, you're probably better off watching a YouTube walkthrough. Or skip altogether.
