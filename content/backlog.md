## Completed
* OFF - **3/5**
  * Another RPG Maker cult favorite that is unrelenting in fulfilling its author's vision. A tough one to place; uses the bog standard out-of-the-box RPG Maker turn-based combat, even keeping the included stock sound effects. The game is translated from French, and at times it felt the translator was leaning a little too heavy on a thesaurus (specifically for the Judge character). The visuals are particularly inspired, being highly surreal and carrying with them a street art-like quality that reminds me of the schizophrenic line art and harsh contrasting colors of Jet Grind Radio. Some confusing use of overly compressed public domain art. OFF seems to relish in its own weirdness a little too much at times, and the gameplay and puzzles suffer for it. An interesting exercise in world-building (which is fitting, given the game's plot).
* Ib - **3/5**
  * An RPG Maker modern classic. A horror game with a creepy atmosphere and multiple endings. Cute plot, and inconsistent visuals. Freeware.
* Minit - **2/5**
  * A game about swords and corporate greed. But mostly a cute indie game that minifies Majora's Mask time travel mechanic to a mere 60 seconds. The gimmick is stretched thin quickly and the game barely does it any justice aside from extract tedium from it. The monochrome graphics, while an obvious stylistic choice, are grating to look at. Decent chiptune music. Fortunately the game does not outstay its welcome.
* Celeste - **4/5**
  * A fantastic modern platformer that is at times brutally unforgiving. The story presents a nice message but without much subtlety, and is sometimes excruciatingly on the nose. Great soundtrack.
* The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - **4/5**
  * A landmark in open-world 3D game development. After over a decade of sticking to a proven formula, Nintendo took inspiration from the series' roots and reinvented the series whilst making bold innovations to the genre.
* Inside - **3/5**
  * A 2D adventure reminiscent of Limbo. Bleak, haunting presentation with glimpses of a more personal message, tied together with mediocre gameplay.
* Dragon Quest III (SNES) - **2/5**
  * A classic 2D JRPG that influenced a decade of role-playing games to come. Charming dialogue and world-building, undercut by turn-based gameplay that has not aged well, and a ridiculous need for grind.
* The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - **4/5**
  * Great dialogue, great graphics, great characterization. One of the most fleshed out open-world 3D games ever created.
* Resident Evil 2 - **4/5**
  * A successor to the legendary survival horror video game that hits all the marks and improves upon the gameplay of the original.
* Resident Evil 0 - **3/5**
  * A good rendition of the ol' Resident Evil formula with worthy visuals and level design. Some clunky new mechanics made its way into this game.
* Resident Evil HD Remaster - **5/5**
  * The definitive way to play the greatest survival horror game of all time.

## Abandoned

* Night In The Woods
  * A game with fantastic visuals, animation, and music that places more emphasis on its narrative and (unfortunately) uninteresting characters than its gameplay, which is practically non-existent at least for the first couple hours of playtime. The humor of this game regularly falls flat and can be called anything but timeless -- much of it is equivalent to the quirky randomness you'd probably encounter everyday from browsing your Twitter feed. Like many from this era of narrative-driven indie games, you're probably better off watching a YouTube walkthrough. Or skip altogether.
